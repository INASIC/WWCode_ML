# How to handle missing data in Python

I attended a machine learning and artificial intelligence meetup in Makati, Metro Manilla, in the Phillipines. In this meetup we discussed the k-nearest neighbours classifier, and had a workshop where we looked at __how to handle missing data in python__ using the Pima Indians Diabetes Data Set, a data set known to have many missing values.  

I have attached a Jupyter Notebook, where I presented my progress to the others in this workshop.
